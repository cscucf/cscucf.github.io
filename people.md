**Dr. Luis Favela (Advisor)**
![Dr. F's Face](/assets/Favela_Pic.JPG)
Dr. Favela is Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences. He was a Fellow at the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Philosophy of Science and Duke University's Summer Seminars in Neuroscience and Philosophy, as well as Visiting Researcher at Indiana University Bloomington's Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. He is an Associate Editor of the journal Cognitive Systems Research and was Secretary-Treasurer Elect and Executive Committee member for the Society for Philosophy and Psychology. Dr. Favela's research attempts to understand mind (i.e., behavior, cognition, and consciousness) from a naturalistic and interdisciplinary perspective. He has published in cognitive science, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology venues. This work centers on three interrelated areas. The first defends complexity science as the appropriate framework to investigate and explain mind. The second centers on non-brain-centric forms of mind, especially embodied and extended. The third applies the first two to experimental research and involves articulating and applying dynamical analyses and modeling, which he employed in work on decision-making, neuronal networks, and perception-action experiments.  <br/><br/>
