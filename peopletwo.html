  <p>
    Bryan Medina is a Senior at UCF, majoring in Computer Science and
    Mathematics. His research interests include human audition, deep learning,
    and computational neuroscience. He is deeply interested in uncovering the
    neural mechanisms that make human perception of sound possible, using recent
    advances in deep learning. He wishes to pursue a Ph.D. in Computational
    Neuroscience. The day of reckoning is coming.s

  <p>
    Samuel Rincon is a Senior at UCF, majoring in Psychology and specializing in
    neuroscience. His research interests include neuroimaging, psychiatric
    populations, and computational methods. He seeks to use computational
    methods, namely graph theory, to see possible functional and network level
    changes in psychiatric populations. He wishes to pursue a Ph.D. in
    Neuroscience.

  <strong>Dr. Luis Favela (Advisor)</strong>
  <img src="/assets/Favela_Pic.JPG" alt="Dr. Favela's Face" />
  <p>
    Dr. Favela is Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences. He
    was a Fellow at the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Philosophy of
    Science and Duke University's Summer Seminars in Neuroscience and
    Philosophy, as well as Visiting Researcher at Indiana University
    Bloomington's Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory in the
    Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. He is an Associate Editor of
    the journal Cognitive Systems Research and was Secretary-Treasurer Elect and
    Executive Committee member for the Society for Philosophy and Psychology.
    Dr. Favela's research attempts to understand mind (i.e., behavior,
    cognition, and consciousness) from a naturalistic and interdisciplinary
    perspective. He has published in cognitive science, neuroscience,
    philosophy, and psychology venues. This work centers on three interrelated
    areas. The first defends complexity science as the appropriate framework to
    investigate and explain mind. The second centers on non-brain-centric forms
    of mind, especially embodied and extended. The third applies the first two
    to experimental research and involves articulating and applying dynamical
    analyses and modeling, which he employed in work on decision-making,
    neuronal networks, and perception-action experiments.
